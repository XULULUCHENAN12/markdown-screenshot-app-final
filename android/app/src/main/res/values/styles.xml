         On API level 21+, this should be set to android:Theme.Black or a similar black
         theme to prevent an ugly transition when the Flutter UI initializes.

         WARNING: only Android >= 21 will use themes in AndroidManifest.xml, in
         combination with the Android theme in the Flutter app.

         This theme determines the color of the Android Window while your
         Flutter UI initializes, as well as behind your Flutter UI while its
         running.

         This Theme is only used starting with V2 of Flutter's Android embedding. -->
