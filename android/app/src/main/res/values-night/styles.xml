         This should be replaced with android:Theme.Black or a similar black
         theme to prevent an ugly transition when the Flutter UI initializes.

         For more details, see https://flutter.dev/go/android-theme in the
         Flutter documentation. -->

    <!-- Theme applied to the Android Application once the process has started.
         This theme determines the color of the Android Window while your
         Flutter UI initializes, as well as behind your Flutter UI while its
         running.

         This Theme is only used starting with V2 of Flutter's Android embedding. -->
